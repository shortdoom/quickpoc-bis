# quickpoc-bis

forked! easy POC template generation from the command line

## personal changes

- add .env (just because)
- fix messy directories by just flattening everything into /src
- fix import paths to be always relative (compiler doesn't mind)
- adjust pragma solidity in POC.t.sol (90% of cases require it)
- remappings only for /lib (some edge cases are nasty)
- comments!

## personal note

catching edge cases in bash is hard. some of edge cases user needs to for now resolve manually:

- missing last closing bracket for some contracts downloaded
- "pragma abicoder v2;" missing when needed in POC.t.sol
- remember to provide checksumed address otherwise tests will not build
- no edge case for import paths using ' and not " (uni v3)
- forge-std won't compile for <0.6.2
- ...more

best to run `forge build` inside the directory and just resolve manually

other best is to just re-write in python

## edge cases

requiring always different type of intervention. after resolving contracts will compile.

## features

from the command line, call `quickpoc 0x.. [folder_name]` to generate a ready-to-go sandbox for running POCs for the given address against mainnet, including:

- forge template with name mirroring contract name
- `src/` folder populated with all contracts and libraries
- test file autogenerated with contract import
- test setup with contract variable and mainnet forking
- `cd folder_name` copied to clipboard to save you 1 extra second

you can run `forge test` to confirm it's working, then go into `tests/POC.t.sol` to interact with the contract (saved in storage as `c`).

## install

0) on a UNIX machine with bash installed, install all dependencies:
- foundry ([follow instructions here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry))
- jq (`brew install jq`)
- graphviz (`brew install graphviz`)
- surya (`npm i -g surya`)
- sol2uml (`npm i -g sol2uml`)

1) download the `quickpoc` file from this repo.

2) set up two environment variables by calling the following from your terminal:
- `export ETH_RPC_URL="..."`
- `export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="..."`

3) you can then run it directly by calling the file (`./quickpoc`) 

4) more conveniently, install it globally:
- put it somewhere you won't touch it (usually `~/bin`)
- if this folder isn't already in your path, open your bash run control file (for example, `~/.zshrc`) and add the following line: `export PATH="$PATH:/Users/path_to_folder_holding_file`
- call `chmod +x path_to_file` to make the file executable
- you should then be able to call `quickpoc 0x..` from any folder to generate the POC folder within it.

## future

- [ ] support non-mainnet networks
- [ ] allow inputting multiple addresses
- [ ] automatically pull all contracts listed on an immunefi page

please submit issues for any additional features you'd like to see :)
